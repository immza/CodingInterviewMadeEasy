This is a coding based Interview platform designed for ease of interviews for the recruiters. Cenetred on just one platform, the interviewers of the company would be able to login into the system using individual google credentials and schedule meetings accordingly with the applicants. There is a video and audio feature included along with the code board just on the right which is a real time code board that allows the interviewer to review the code live. The questions and the programming languages can be changed as per preference. I have also integrated the screen recording option and along with it the ability to screen record videos and save it for later within.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
